            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It 
            has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making 
            it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at 
            Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
            Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
            the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
            source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus 
            Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 
            45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during 
            the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
            comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced 
            below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus 
            Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original 
            form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by 
            H. Rackham.
